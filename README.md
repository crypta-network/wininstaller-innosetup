Because this is Windows software it is okay for a file to not have an ending newline.
If you edit such a file please keep it that way.

So that they can be uploaded to Transifex there are two encodings of the
localization files. UTF8 as required by Transifex, and usually-ANSI, as required
by InnoSetup.

To convert between them see
[convert-inno-setup](https://github.com/freenet/scripts/blob/master/convert-inno-setup).
